# Chorus Connector

### Instructions

Chorus Connector is an exciting new product to help lovers of choral music find ensembles! 
Build an appealing application with the following features:

All users:
- view all choruses
- search for choruses near their location
- optionally indicate their membership in certain choruses (up to you whether this is a direct action or requires admin approval)

Admins:
- create, view, edit, and delete users and choruses
- add and remove users from choruses

`data.json` contains an initial list of people and choruses with associated cities and states. Data can be stored in-memory however you prefer. This example data includes an is_admin flag for your convenience, but how you handle user roles is up to you.

Other considerations (be selective, given the time constraint):
- authentication
- accessibility
- testing

Fork this repository and expand upon it using your preferred folder structure, tooling, packages, libraries, etc.

This template provides a minimal setup for an Angular app. Note that the Angular CLI requires Node.js v14.20+, v16.14+ or v18.10+. To run the app:
```
cd chorus-connector
npm install
ng serve
```
Update this README with anything we should know about your solution (including spin-up and testing instructions, if relevant).
